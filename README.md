### Description

Heard of the Cuckoo Egg? It is a mp3 file of music with random sounds inserted in the mp3 file. It is done for musicians who wish to fight a battle with napster from within. Making a cuckoo egg can be slow and this program makes a Hollow Egg, which is kind of like the Cuckoo Egg except it makes a totally blank mp3 file that has the size, bitrate, and length of a real mp3.
